/*================================================================
Reverse Sorting:
  - Consider that reverse or normal sort could be just another state 
    (e.g. isReverse) next to the sortKey.

  - Set the new state in the handleSort handler based on the previous sort.

  - Use the new isReverse state for sorting the list with the sort 
    function from the dictionary with the optionally applied reverse() 
    function from JavaScript arrays.

==================================================================
Previous Task: Sorting:
  - Sorting an array with JavaScript isn't trivial, so we will 
    use Lodash. 
      npm install lodash

  - Next create a Javascript object (also called dictionary in this case)


==================================================================
Previous Task: Forms in React:

   Task:
    - First, wrap the input field and button into an HTML 
   form element: (YY1)

    - Next, since the handler is used for the form event, 
    it executes preventDefault() additionally on React's synthetic 
    event. This prevents the HTML form's native behavior which would 
    lead to a browser reload:    
       const handleSearchSubmit = (event) => {
          setUrl(`${API_ENDPOINT}${searchTerm}`);
          event.preventDefault(); <--- Add this
        };

   Previous Async Await in React
     In our React application, we have started to resolve promises 
   with then/catch blocks. However, in modern JavaScript (and therefore React), 
   a more popular solution is using async/await.
  
   Previous Task: Async Await
     - First, you would have to replace the then/catch syntax 
       with the async/await syntax. 
     
     - refactor of the handleFetchStories() function shows how to 
       accomplish it with  error handling: (X1)
 
   Previous Task: Use Third Party Library - Axios 
     Not all browser supports "fetch". 

     One alternative is to substitute the native fetch API with a 
   stable library like axios, which performs asynchronous requests 
   to remote APIs. In this section, we will discover how to substitute 
   a library -- a native API of the browser in this case -- with another 
   library from the npm registry.
   
   Optional Hints Explicit Data Fetching Using Axios:
     - run npm install axios in VSCode terminal

     - add import statement: 
         import axios from 'axios'; 

     - modify handleFetchStories;

    Previous Task Explicit Data Fetching: 
       The server-side search executes every time a user types into 
   the input field. The new implementation should only execute a search 
   when a user clicks a confirmation button. As long as the button is 
   not clicked, the search term can change but isn't executed as 
   API request.

   Previous Task: (from prev section memoizing) Kept it here so that I wont forget.
     We will refactor the code upfront to use a memoized 
   function and provide the explanations afterward. The refactoring 
   consists of moving all the data fetching logic from the 
   side-effect into a arrow function expression (A), wrapping this 
   new function into React's useCallback hook (B), and invoking 
   it in the useEffect hook (C):

  Optional Hints Explicit Data Fetching:
    - 
    - (AA) Add a button element to confirm the search request.
      But first of all, create a new button element which confirms 
      the search and executes the data request eventually (AA)

    - (BB) rename handler 'handleSearch' to handleSearchInput. 
     
      (CC)Create a a handler for the button which sets the new 
      state value. The button's event handler sets confirmed search as 
      state by using the current search term.  
         
    - Only when the new confirmed search is set as state, 
      execute the side-effect to perform a server-side search.
 
    - (DD) after creating a handler for the button, create a state 
      called 'url' using the API and concatenated with the value of the 
      search input box
           const [url, setUrl] = React.useState(
              `${API_ENDPOINT}${searchTerm}`);

     - (EE) Instead of running the data fetching side-effect on 
      every searchTerm change (which happens each time the 
      input field's value changes like we have seen before), 
      the new stateful url is used whenever a user changes it 
      by confirming a search request when clicking the button:

      TO TEST: enter search criteria and click Submit button
     
  Review what is useState?
      - https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-usestate-hook/

      - When a state gets mutated, the component with the state 
      and all child components will re-render.

      - Use the browser's native fetch API to perform the request.

      - Note: A successful or erroneous request uses the same 
      implementation logic that we already have in place.
      
  Review what is useEffect?
    - https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-useeffect-hook/
    
    - What does useEffect do? by using this hook you tell React that 
     your component needs to do something after render.

  Review what is a React.Reducer
    - https://www.robinwieruch.de/javascript-reducer/

=============================================*/
import * as React from 'react';
import axios from 'axios'
import { sortBy } from 'lodash';

const API_ENDPOINT = 'https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?query=';

/* No need for this because we will fetch data directly using the API
const getAsyncStories = () =>
  new Promise((resolve) =>
    setTimeout(
      () => resolve({ data: { stories: initialStories } }),
      2000
    )
  ); */

//Again the first thing to do when using React.useReducer hook
//is to define a reducer function outside of the component.
//A reducer function always receives a state and an action. 
//Based on these two arguments, returns a new state.

/* 
 We changed two things from the above original reducer function. 
   1. First, we introduced new types when we called the dispatch 
      function from the outside. 
      Therefore we need to add the following new cases for state transitions.
         'STORIES_FETCH_INIT' 
         'STORIES_FETCH_SUCCESS'
         'STORIES_FETCH_FAILURE'
         'REMOVE_STORY'
         throw new Error();
   2. Second, we changed the state structure from an array to 
      a complex object. Therefore we need to take the new complex 
      object into account as incoming state and returned state:

   3.For every state transition, we return a new state object 
     which contains all the key/value pairs from the current 
     state object (via JavaScript's spread operator ...state) and 
     the new overwriting properties 
     
     For example, STORIES_FETCH_FAILURE sets the 
     isLoading boolean to false and sets the isError boolean 
     to true, while keeping all the the other state intact 
     (e.g. data alias stories)

  /*   Memoized useEffect
    After merging the three useState hooks into one Reducer hook,
  we cannot use the state updater functions from React's 
  useState Hooks anymore like:
       setIsLoading, setIsError
  everything related to asynchronous data fetching must now use 
  the new dispatch function "dispatchStories" see (A)
  for updating state transitions 

  React.useEffect(() => {

     if `searchTerm` is not present
      e.g. null, empty string, undefined
      do nothing
      more generalized condition than searchTerm === '' 

    if (!searchTerm) return;
     dispatchStories receiving different payload
     dispatchStories({ type: 'STORIES_FETCH_INIT' }); //for init
                     //dispatchStories receives STORIES_FETCH_INIT as type

    First - API is used to fetch popular tech stories for a certain query 
            (a search term). In this case  we fetch stories about 'react' (B)

    Second - the native browser's fetch API (see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
             to make this request.
             For 'fetch' API, the response needs to be translated to JSON (C)
    
    Finally - the returned result has a different data structure which we send
              payload to our component's state reducer (dispatchStories)
   
    We need to migrate the search to server-side search
    Instead of using the hardcoded search term (here: 'react'), use the 
    actual searchTerm from the component's state like the following code.

    fetch(`${API_ENDPOINT}${searchTerm}`) // B
      .then((response) => response.json()) // C
      .then((result) => {
         dispatchStories({
           type: 'STORIES_FETCH_SUCCESS',
           payload: result.hits, //D
         });
      })
      .catch(() =>
        dispatchStories({type:'STORIES_FETCH_FAILURE'})
      );
    }, [searchTerm]); //If we would want to run the side-effect also when the
                       searchTerm changes, we would have to include it in 
                      the dependency array:

  //  1. Mainly what we did is to extract a function from React's useEffect Hook

                                    //to execute is: (list) => sortBy(list, 'points').reverse(),

  //Depending on the isReverse state, execute the sort function
  //from the dictionary with or without the built-in javascript
  //reverse method                                  
  const sortedList = sort.isReverse ? sortFunction(list).reverse() : sortFunction(list);

  /*
   In the List component's header, buttons can help us to set the 
   sort state for each column/property. An inline handler is used 
   to sneak in the sort-specific key (sortKey). For example when the 
   button for the "Title" column is clicked, 'TITLE' becomes the 
   new sort state:

   Recap: 
      1. First we extracted the sort function from the dictionary by its 
         sortKey (state), 
         Then we applied the function to the list before mapping it to 
         render each Item component. Example:
           AUTHOR: (list) => sortBy(list, 'author')
           
      2. Second, we rendered HTML buttons as header columns to give our 
         users interaction. 
      
      3. Then, we added implementation details for each 
         button by changing the sort state. 
         
      4. Finally, we used the sort state to sort the actual list

 //useState
    By using useState, we are telling React that we want to have a 
 stateful value which changes over time. And whenever this stateful value 
 changes, the affected components (here: Search component) 
 will re-render to use it (here: to display the recent value).

  //Work flow of a useState:
       When the user types into the input field, the input field's change event 
      runs into the event handler. The handler's logic uses the event's value 
      of the target and the state updater function to set the updated state. 
      Afterward, the component re-renders (read: the component function runs). 
      The updated state becomes the current state (here: searchTerm) and is 
      displayed in the component's JSX.

  //Arrow Function
    function getTitle(title) { - convert to arrow function see below
    
    const getTitle =(title) => 
       (
        title
       );

    Eliminate bracket and "return" statement if no business logic before 
    the function - concise
   

  //Arrow function - 
   If there is a business business logic. Otherwise retain the {} and
   put a "return" statement 
     const App = () => {
       ...
       return xyz;
     } 
 
  //How to use a React.Reducer hook 
  To use Reducer (1) first define a reducer function.
     1. A reducer action is always associated with a type. As best 
        practice with a payload.
        Example:
          const storiesReducer = (state, action) =>{
          if (action.type === 'SET_STORIES'){
            //If the type matches a condition in the reducer. Return a new
            //state based on the incoming state and action
            return action.payload;
          }
          else{
          //throw an error if isn't covered by the reducer to remind yourself
          //that the implementation is not covered
            throw new Error();
          }
        }
      2. The second thing to do is to replaceReact.useState to use a reducer hook
         like this: 

          const [stories, dispatchStories] = React.useReducer(storiesReducer,[]);

          1. receives a reducer function called "storiesReducer"
          2. receives an initial state of empty array []
          3. returns an array with 2 item: 
            - The first item is "stories" which is the current state
            - The second item is the updater function named "dispatchStories"
            Unlike useState, the updater function of Reducer sets the state
            "implicitly" by dispatching an "action". Example:
               dispatchStories({
                 type: 'SET_STORIES',   <== this is the action
               payload: result.data.stories,
             });
